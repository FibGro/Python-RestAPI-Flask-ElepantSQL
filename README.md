# Temperature Data Using RESTAPI and Flask (Method : GET and POST) 

This script sets up a Flask web application with endpoints for creating rooms, adding temperature data, 
and retrieving global average temperature information. It connects to a ElepantSQL database using the 
psycopg2 library and performs database operations based on incoming requests. The SQL statements define the 
schema for the rooms and temperatures tables, and the routes handle the corresponding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
